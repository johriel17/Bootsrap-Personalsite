                <br>BIOGRAPHY<br><br>
My name is Leo rivera. I was raised in a small rural town in New Hampshire that is part of 
what’s known as the Upper Valley, a cluster of small towns and villages in both New Hampshire 
and Vermont that are divided by the Connecticut River. The city of Lebanon, like many small 
New England towns included in the “UV”, contains a rich history deriving from its early colonial 
settlement and the presence of Dartmouth College. I spent 19 years there before leaving to 
attend Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio.
My relationship with the guitar began in high school at the suggestion of my high school 
guidance counselor. I was lacking enough credits to graduate, and was feeling disillusioned with 
high school, my classes and American culture in general. In addition to the guitar class at 
school, I began studying with Classical guitarist Ed Eastridge. From the beginning, the guitar 
captivated and challenged me. In spite of my passion for the instrument, I attended Antioch 
College as a Creative Writing major minoring in Musical Composition, but found myself 
spending all my time when I wasn’t in class playing the guitar. In 2005, a college friend invited 
me to come to visit Madrid Spain where I experienced Flamenco for the first time. I had never 
seen or heard the guitar played that way and I returned from the trip a changed man. I tried to 
teach myself how to play Flamenco guitar by studying YouTube videos and with other 
instructions I found online but came to the conclusion that if I wanted to gain any real skill I 
would need to go to the source. I left Antioch in my Sophomore year, moving to Madrid Spain in 
2006 and my Flamenco guitar studies began when I started studying with world-renowned 
Flamenco guitar teacher Aquilino 'El Entri' Jimenez. From 2006 to 2009 I studied under El Entri 
at the Amor de Dios Flamenco academy, learning to accompany Flamenco song and dance as 
well as perform solo pieces for the guitar. I admired the work ethics of great guitarists like Paco 
de Lucia and would often practice six to ten hours a day trying to 'catch up'. When El Entri 
established his own Flamenco school, the Cañorroto Academia in the famed 'Cañorroto' 
neighborhood, I moved with him and continued to learn side by side with other up and coming 
Flamenco artists such as Joni Jimenez and El Kilino. In 2010 and 2011, I returned to New 
England to perform two summer concert tours, playing traditional Flamenco pieces along with 
my own original compositions. 
Many of my fellow Flamenco students have gone on to have successful Flamenco guitar 
careers but after only studying for a couple of years I found myself becoming disillusioned with Flamenco and my career as a Flamenco guitarist. The people I study Flamenco with and who 
have gone on to have those successful Flamenco careers, all began playing Flamenco when 
they were quite young. Some were as young as five years old when they began. I was in my 
early 20s which meant that most of my fellow Flamenco students had already been playing for 
10 years or more. I wondered when I would be 'good', if ever, at playing these traditional 
Flamenco pieces. I had two realizations that helped me formulate my decision to begin moving 
in my own direction. One was that I felt a great need to perform my own music and not that of 
others. The second was that I am not a Gypsy. And even if I learned all the Flamenco 
techniques and played them perfectly I would never be able to feel Flamenco music the way the 
Gypsy, also known as Roma, people do-as part of the cultural history of the life and struggles of 
the Roma people. As a result, in 2008, I began listening to more Classical music and began 
composing my own pieces, being greatly influenced by Bach and Beethoven's compositional 
structure. I felt that Flamenco lacked this more structured approach to composition but I also felt 
that Classical lacked Flamenco's strong rhythmic base. I decided to create a form of music that 
had both the rhythmic complexity of Flamenco and the structural integrity of Classical. Thus, 
pieces such as 'Darkness Kept' and 'Last Stars' were born from this desire to fuse the two 
musical styles, from a series of short poems I had written around the same time, and my lifetime 
struggle with depression.
